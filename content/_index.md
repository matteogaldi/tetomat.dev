I'm interested in computer science, especially distributed systems, and I enjoy backpacking, hiking, and sci-fi. I believe in the strength of community and sharing knowledge.

Here are some principles I believe in:



**Read the Docs**  
Always dive into the documentation rather than jumping to conclusions by merely skimming through the code. Try to grasp the rationale behind the code's behaviour.

**Dive In and Experiment**  
Challenge yourself to reinvent the wheel, but know when to use established solutions. If you need to implement SHA-512, attempt it yourself, and then opt for a solution crafted by someone with expertise.

**Comprehend the Entire Tech Stack**  
If your code operates within a Linux environment, shielded by a firewall, behind a NAT, and served by Nginx, make it your mission to understand the full tech stack and the complete journey of your request.

**Continue Learning**  
Embrace the journey of continuous exploration and learning.

**Embrace Open Source**  
Lean on open-source codeâ€”inspect and understand it as much as possible. Contribute however you can, be it through a translation, an idea, or more. Don't be a dick.

**Promote Open Knowledge**  
Share your knowledge openly with others. Cooperate, don't compete.

**Plain Files**  
Maintain notes and crucial information (excluding passwords, please) in simple, accessible formats like txt, md, or html, ensuring access across different operating systems and devices.

**Avoid Vendor Lock-In**  
Balance reliance on service providers with your autonomy, ensuring you maintain backups of essential data that remain accessible even in the event of a service shutdown.

**AI**  
Use AI if you want to, but, please, for all mankind, don't let it reason for you. Let it be an help instead of a solution.

**Walk**  
Take walks in nature and forget about your monitor when you can.

**Live Free**  
Double-check what you read, engage your brain, and stay informed.
